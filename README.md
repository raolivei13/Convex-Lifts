# Convex-Lifts
This literature review offers a concise overview of the theory and applications related to lifts of convex sets. A lift of a convex set is a higher-dimensional convex set that can be linearly projected onto the original set. In many cases, lifting a convex set to a higher dimension simplifies its structure significantly. These convex lifts are particularly important in the field of optimization. The paper emphasizes the necessity of such convex lifts and provides examples to help develop an intuitive understanding of these structures.

A key problem when dealing with convex sets is determining whether a polyhedral or spectrahedral lift exists, a question that is both fundamental and challenging. Ideally, we aim to find a low-complexity polyhedral or spectrahedral lift, or alternatively, identify an "obstruction" that proves no such lift is possible. The paper also explores the connection between the existence of lifts for a convex set and certain structured factorizations of its associated slack operator, offering some theoretical bounds on the possible dimensions of these lifts. This review is focused exclusively on lifts of convex sets, with a particular emphasis on the lifts of polytopes and spectrahedra.
